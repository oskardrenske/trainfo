**How to book mandatory seat reservations for Swedish trains if you have an Interrail / Eurail pass.**

["If you have an Interrail/Eurail as a paper ticket, you need to contact the retailer you purchased the card from to make a seat reservation."](https://www.sj.se/en/customer-service/frequently-asked-questions/158/eurail) (SJ)

Check Railplanner for which trains have mandatory reservations and also the country information to see participating companies

### Track works

The planning for track works often takes time, so trains might be unavailable for booking until uncomfortably close to the departure date.

## SJ

[https://www.sj.se/](https://www.sj.se/)

[https://www.sj.se/en/customer-service/frequently-asked-questions/5205/how-do-i-make-a-reservation-with-interrail-eurail/](https://www.sj.se/en/customer-service/frequently-asked-questions/5205/how-do-i-make-a-reservation-with-interrail-eurail/)

No SJ trains from/to Copenhagen during 2025. Take Öresundståg (no reservation possible) to Malmö and book from there.

### Language

Go to `sj.se` and change language to English, (…) in the lower right if you are on a browser on your phone. There’s an entry with a Swedish flag, open it and change language.

### Searching

Search only for the part of your trip that has mandatory reservation. _Do not include parts that do not have mandatory reservation. (e.g. Öresundståg)_

E.g.

Copenhagen- Stockholm with a change from Öresundståg in Malmö 🛑

That won’t work, change search to Malmö - Stockholm, the section with mandatory reservations. The part with öresundståg from Copenhagen to Malmö is just a journey you'll have to add to your trip in Railplanner.

Copenhagen- Stockholm without changes ✅

If you include other trains, SJ will sell you a regular ticket for that part.

### Add interrail

Add Interrail with pass number to all travelers (customise) and activate the toggle for “travels with travel card”. Select “Interrail or Eurail” from the drop down menu and add your pass Numbers in the “card number” field.

## Select ticket

Select “refundable”

Prices (for a seat in a SJ high speed train) should be:

2 class 75 SEK per reservation

1 class 165 SEK per reservation

And it should say that it’s an interrail price

Select seat from the seat map if you want

These prices are for day trains, prices for night trains (especially those to/from Germany) are more expensive. But reservations for domestic Intercity are cheaper.

It's not possible to travel in "2nd class calm" with Interrail.

I should update the screenshots, but you get the point :)

If you cancel the reservation, there’s a 10 SEK fee, so you’ll get 55 out of 65 SEK back.

Prices:

#### Price (SEK) of a SJ reservation with Interrail

|  | 2 class | 1 class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HIgh Speed Trains | 75 | 165 |
| InterCity | 40 | 40 |
| Euronight to Germany. Seat / Couchette / Sleeper | 195 / 395 / 875 | 1490 |
| Domestic night trains Seat / Couchette / Sleeper | 195 / 395 / 875 | N/A / N/A / 800 |

It’s not possible to book “2nd class calm” with Interrail.

#### A valid Interrail pass number is required

If SJ’s ticket system doesn’t accept the number, a non-specific error message is shown.

Trick if it's full:

The train isn't full all the way, but it's possible that you can't book a specific seat all the way. E.g. Malmö - Stockholm is full. Work your way backwards until you can reserve a seat. Norrköping - Linköping and so forth. That'll take you part of the way on the high speed train. From there your options are to try to book another seat the rest of the way or take regional trains. This way of booking should work in all countries where seat reservations is mandatory. Sure, it's more expensive, so it depends on if you value time or money.

## Snälltåget

[https://www.snalltaget.se/en](https://www.snalltaget.se/en#)

A lot more straightforward: Check `“I have an Interrail or Eurail Pass”` and enter your pass number.

Snälltåget doesn't have any sleeper cabins in their night trains, only couchettes and seats. They also release tickets earlier than SJ, they can do that since they don't sell with connections like SJ often does.

### VY

https://www.vy.se/en

Night trains to the north of Sweden. Select "`Seat reservation for interrail/eurail`" and enter your Interrail pass number. Search and select "Fully flexible tickets",

![](images/interrail-in-sweden_1.png?w=438)

Prices:

Base fee of SEK 50 + specific fees:

Seat: No extra fee = SEK 50 total

Bed in couchette: SEK +190 = 240 total

Bed in sleeper: SEK +420 = 470 total

All options (including buying a private compartment) are visible after searching for a specific train.

It's also possible to book these trains on the Sj website, but they are slightly more expensive.
